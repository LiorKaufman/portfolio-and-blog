    content: |-
      I'm a self-taught data engineer who's enthusiastic about problem-solving and all things data-related. I like to think of myself as a versatile learner with a strong focus on data. I enjoy discovering new databases and delving into their inner workings. What truly piques my interest is understanding the architecture of databases and how they can be employed to tackle various challenges.

      I am currently learning: The Rust programming language in hopes of one day building my own database. Right now focusing on building small command line tools and reading Command-Line Rust by Ken Youens-Clark to learn the best practices.
